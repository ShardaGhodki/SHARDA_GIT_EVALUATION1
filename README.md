Git is a distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency. Created by Linus Torvalds in 2005, Git allows multiple developers to work on a project simultaneously without overwriting each other's changes. It keeps track of code changes, supports non-linear development through branches, and provides tools for collaboration and version tracking. Git's architecture includes features like staging areas, commits, and repositories, ensuring code integrity and facilitating efficient workflows. Widely used in software development, Git is foundational for version control in many collaborative and open-source projects.
